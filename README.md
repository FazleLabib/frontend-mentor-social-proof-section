## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to add multiple images as background images. Also figured out how to play with positioning of divs. I was able to position the rating cards and the review cards by manipulating the margins as shown in the given css code.


<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
``` -->
```css
body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    
    background-image: url(./images/bg-pattern-top-desktop.svg), url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom-desktop.svg);
    background-size: 60rem, 95rem;
    background-position: top left, bottom right;
    background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
}

#c-2 {
    margin-bottom: -1rem;
    margin-top: 1rem;
}

#c-3 {
    margin-bottom: -2rem;
    margin-top: 2rem;
}

```
<!-- ```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Useful resources

- [CSS3 Backgrounds](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This helped me use multiple images as the background image.
